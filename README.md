# Grounded
A quick, cheap, easy way to solve the farming crisis many poor people face.

According to the UN, 1/3 of the world's poor population resorts to farming for a source of income. However, this low end farming usually results with an unstable income, that too barely any to put on the table. To make matters worse, crops that they are able to produce are killed by three huge factors: heat exhaustion, moisture extrema, and underground gas leaks.

Enter Grounded: The cheapest way to detect these three occurences and chart out the data on a graph. Finally, it will tell the farmer if it is safe to plant crops.

How does it work? The device is put into the ground next to the plants. Once grounded(hence the name of the item), the sensors begin taking data and uploading it to the cloud. This device can take up to a THOUSAND different data points and plot them on a graph.

This idea was created by Shaun Munshi for the Teenhacks 2018 Hackathon. The team was Shaun Munshi(Leader), Shlok Mehrotra, Pranav Srisankar, and Shubham Kumar. This project won first place out of 151 participants.
